# pve-moosefs
MooseFS on Proxmox. This is **HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!** Please do not be upset at me if it eats your data!

## DISCLAIMER
This is NOT production ready yet. It's probably only interesting to Proxmox developers and extremely daring people. You've been warned.

## Usage
Perform the following steps on your Proxmox host(s):

* Clone this Git repository and enter it with `cd`
* Make the Debian package: `make`
* Install the Debian package: `dpkg -i *.deb`

Now mount the storage:
`pvesm add moosefs moosefs-vm-storage --path /mnt/mfs`

In this example, we create a custom storage called "moosefs-vm-storage" using the moosefs plugin we just installed.

You can apply the following optional settings:
* --mfsmaster mfsmaster.my.hostname - Set the mfsmaster IP or hostname to help MooseFS find the metadata server(s).
* --mfspassword mypasswordhere - If your MooseFS exports require a password to mount MooseFS, set this.
* --mfsport 9421 - If you're running the mfsmaster on a custom port, you can set this. Note: Doesn't currently do anything ðŸš§

## Future features
* Instant snapshots, rollbacks etc
* mfsbdev support for high performance?
* mfssubfolder support
