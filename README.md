# pve-moosefs

**MooseFS integration for Proxmox VE**

This plugin enables native support for MooseFS as a storage backend in Proxmox VE.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This project is highly experimental.**

> ⚠️ **Do NOT use snapshots in MooseFS block device (bdev) mode**. They are currently unsafe and may result in data loss. Snapshot support is still under active development and will remain experimental until this warning is removed.

## 🖥️ Mounting MooseFS Storage

### Via GUI

1. Open the **Proxmox Web Interface**
2. Navigate to **Datacenter → Storage**
3. Click **Add → MooseFS** and complete the wizard

### Via Command Line

```bash
pvesm add moosefs moosefs-vm-storage --path /mnt/mfs
```

This command creates a custom storage named `moosefs-vm-storage` using the MooseFS plugin.

#### Optional parameters:

* `--mfsmaster <hostname>` — specify the MooseFS metadata server
* `--mfspassword <password>` — use if your MooseFS export requires authentication
* `--mfssubfolder <folder>` — mount a subfolder rather than the root of the MooseFS volume
* `--mfsport <port>` — coming soon 🚧
